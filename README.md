# SupervisedLearning_BankLoan
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors.
## Goal
To predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.
## Data attributes
* Customer ID: It is the just a identification of the customer of the bank. This attribute wont help us in predicting the future potential loan customers. We can neglect this feature for our model prediction.
* categorical variables:
- Family : family size of the customer; has the values 1,2,3,4
- Education : Education Level. 1: Undergrad; 2: Graduate; 3: Advanced/Professional
- Securities Account : Does the customer have a securities account with the bank? ; column has value 0 or 1
- CD Account : Does the customer have a certificate of deposit(CD)account with the bank? ; column has value 0 or 1
- Online : Does the customer use internet banking facilities? column has values 0 (No) or 1(Yes)
- Credit card : Does the customer use a credit card issued by UniversalBank? ; column has values 0 (No) or 1(Yes)
* Interval varaibles:

- Experience - Years of professional experience of the customer; ranges from 0 to 43, and there are few negative experiences
- Income - Annual income of the customers in dollars ; from  8000ùë°ùëú  224000

-Zip code - zip code of the home address of the customer

* Target Variable 
 - Personal Loan :Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign?
